## **Overview and Origin**

FINIX is a payment infrastructure platform software company on the verge of revolutionizing the payment/billing domain within the FinTech industry. Founded in 2015, the founders Richie Serna & Sean Donovan realized that there was a market to target and they believed that they had the knowledge and client base to build a company that can empower companies by showcasing them the benefits of becoming their own
[payment facilitators,"PayFac's"](https://www.paymentfacilitator.com/business/what-is-the-payment-facilitator-model/). [^1] FINIX founders are extremely confident due to their infrastructure, technology and recent [C-level hires](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/finix-exceeds-100m-in-funding-and-adds-execs-from-google-tesla-and-uber-to-its-c-suite-301234156.html) that will allow their mission become successful.

## **Business Activities**

Currently, FINIX is targeting software companies that require a revamped infrastructure and are in the [growth stage](https://blog.finixpayments.com/managed-payments-made-simple). The key to FINIX's success and growth in the payment segment is their unique API database which is supported by Java Script which allows for any company to come into their [database library](https://developers.finixpayments.com/). Due to the inter complexities of payment management, FINIX's technology has the capability of managing the entire payment flow from start to finish in any coding language that is used by their clients. Furthermore, FINIX's technology allows for them to tailor specific requests from their clients to meet the needs of the industry the client is working for. 

## **Landscape**

INIX's endeavor to take on the big Payment Facilitators [^2], is not the typical approach of taking on major companies. Rather, FINIX's understanding that they can offer a more efficient and effective process to handle their payment platform through their technology, FINIX can continue to improve on their software and create a niche market for the billing/ payment domain. Currently, FINIX focuses on companies that have payment residual streams [^3] they can educate their clients on the benefits of optimizing the costs and increasing revenue through their payment framework.

## **Results**

FINIX has been able to grow significanltly as of recent, thier "transaction volume quadrupled from Q2 2019 to Q2 2020"[Serrna](https://www.fintechfutures.com/2020/09/us-payments-start-up-finix-lands-30m-from-lightspeed-amex/_). This statement is significantly especially since during the COVID-19 pandemic,  companies had not seen the same results or the benifits of what the Payment Industry has to offer.  

## **Recommendations**

During my experience with two technology firms ONICA and SADA, I believe that FINIX is in a situation to provide themselves a foundation that will dramatically change the shift of the payment segment of the FinTech Industry. 
With an interview with one of the angel investors at FINIX, I realized that there is a significant need for companies to realize that they can optimize their bottom line by using FINIX as their partner. 

I began to piece together that FINIX has two avenues to follow:

SADA Systems has the vision to keep their business in-house without the need of merging with other companies/ being bought by other companies, due to the CEO’s strategy on specifically targeting Google Cloud’s Business. The CEO was able to sell a portion of his company that was no longer a part of his vision but would allow for his resources to be 100% committed to Google. Furthermore, in continuation of their vision, SADA built a diverse Board of Directors that are from different industries to allow for responsible decision-making and increase knowledge.

ONICA's vision was different from SADA’s, they grew significantly within the past few years and built a successful business model within AWS Web Services. ONICA's success allowed for them to take on the approach of being acquired by Rackspace Technology. This allied to their vision to improve and build upon the demand for professional AWS services.

My recommendation for FINIX is that they would be better suited to follow the direction of SADA rather than ONICA. The reason for this is that FINIX’s framework and vision will allow them to become an exclusive partner to specific companies. FINIX can offer unique partnerships with big-player companies specifically Visa, MasterCard, and AMEX which will provide FINIX to continue to improve their software and increase their library database. 

This will significantly improve the flexibility and alignment of their future clients.
Leveraging themselves by working with the specific card company's, FINIX will gain significant knowledge and understanding to build within the United States finance infrastructure. 

While building a Board of Directors team that is diverse and unique in target specific industries that FINIX would like to penetrate and offer unique strategies that will align with their vision. 

Through this recommendation, I believe that FINIX will become a significant player in the payment segment within the next few years and will be one of the main reasons for this new paradigm shift within the landscape of the payment world of the FfinTech Industry.
